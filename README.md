# Assessment-4-Exercise

For additional practice, I've attached a progressive spec for a front-end app - meaning you will implement it in stages where the next stage depends on the last. I'd recommend you implement it in either Backbone and React, whichever one you feel more comfortable with (you'll get more chances to catch up with your weaker frameworks during the project phases). I'd also recommend adding some form of server component to this application, one that has a few routes/request handlers that read from and save data to some folder on your computer.
